# ttkExamples
ttk.PanedWindow and ttk.TreeView and scrolling canvas (not a standard library feature- see mgSSDhealthview class) examples
This repository contains some tkinter examples that were challenging to me when first attempted. 
The treeview example enabled limitless depth of tree hierarchy for Windows10 platform storage (DISKS, Volumes, Physical devices, BOOT/ GPT/ OS Partition data views/ and file system views)
The scrolling canvas example allowed me to display rows of storage information with each row containing an off the shelf Button, an off the shelf label, and a run-time generated Pie chart and  bar-percentage display. The rows scroll on an xy 2000x2000 canvas that is viewed in a scrolled parent ~800x700 application top frame.
